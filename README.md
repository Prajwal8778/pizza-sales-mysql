### **Pizza Sales Analysis Project – MySQL**  

**Project Overview:**  
This project is about analyzing and managing data for a pizza business using **MySQL**. The goal is to create a database that stores information about customers, orders, pizzas, and sales, and then use SQL queries to answer important business questions. This helps the pizza shop understand sales trends, customer preferences, and overall performance.  

### **Project Objectives:**  
We will use MySQL to:  
1. **Retrieve basic sales information** like the total number of orders, total revenue, and the most popular pizza types.  
2. **Perform intermediate-level analysis** such as identifying how many pizzas were sold in each category, tracking order patterns by time of day, and grouping data by date for deeper insights.  
3. **Conduct advanced data analysis** to understand how each pizza type contributes to total revenue and identify the top-performing pizzas in different categories.  

### **Basic Analysis (Simple Queries):**  
1. Count the total number of orders placed.  
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from all pizza sales.  
3. Find out which pizza has the highest price.  
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered (e.g., small, medium, large).  
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types and their quantities.  

### **Intermediate Analysis (More Complex Queries):**  
1. Join tables to calculate how many pizzas were sold in each category (e.g., veg, non-veg).  
2. Analyze order distribution by hour to see when the busiest times are.  
3. Group pizzas by category to understand category-wise sales distribution.  
4. Group orders by date to calculate the average number of pizzas sold per day.  
5. Find the top 3 pizzas that generated the most revenue.  

### **Advanced Analysis (Detailed Insights):**  
1. Calculate what percentage of the total revenue each pizza type contributes.  
2. Analyze how revenue has grown over time (cumulative revenue).  
3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types in each category based on revenue.  

### **Why This Project is Important:**  
By building and analyzing this database, we can help the pizza shop make smarter decisions. For example, they can focus on promoting the most popular pizzas, adjust inventory based on demand, and even plan special offers during peak order hours.  

**Tools Used:**  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Analysis:** SQL queries for data retrieval and reporting  

**Outcome:**  
A well-structured database and insightful analysis will give the pizza shop a better understanding of their business, helping them grow and serve their customers more effectively.
